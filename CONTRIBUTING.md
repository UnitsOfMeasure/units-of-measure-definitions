## Non-US Units and Unit Names
For now, we're supporting US English names and common units only.

However, we've had frequent requests to add units that are common in other parts of the world, and we consider it important to be able to address these requests fairly.

In addition, we think having a localization strategy to easily translate already-defined units into other languages is an important requirement.

Both of these features are coming at some point, but for now `en-US` is our only officially supported language, and we'll stick to units of measure used in the US.

See the [associated ticket]((/../../issues/3)) for the current status.

## Conversion Factors
TODO - talk about how quoting an official source for your conversion factor will make it much more likely to be accepted quickly, rather than taking people's word on digit precision.
